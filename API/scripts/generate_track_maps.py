"""Pre-renders every current-season circuit's track-outline SVG into
API/static/track_maps/<circuitId>.svg, so API_Endpoints/map/router.py can
serve a static file on the request path instead of doing a live fastf1
telemetry load on every cold cache hit.

Run manually, or via .github/workflows/regenerate-track-maps.yml (monthly -
track layouts only ever change between seasons, so that's a safety margin,
not a cadence anything actually needs).

Needs TRACK_COLOUR set (same env var map_generator.py reads at request time).
